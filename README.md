Future mod heist raids

 something similar like above, raid ai camps, or bases, police stations, military arifield, or just random places on the map what we as server devs can set up.

Camps: just random coords on the map pre made and what we can setup our self.

Guarding npc's around the camp. easy, medium, hard.

stealing a object, items or vehicle, or destroy a vehicle or objects to steal something after. or all in one. might be fun to add that u need a C4 as player or w/e explosives. stealing drugs, stealing weapons, stealing money.

delivery or sell location depens on what the mission is this can be random places, the npc will come to u on the location.

ai will chase u down when u need to deliver or sell same what i said above with myCarthief.

police will interact as well ai and player police if it is a RP server.

Police stations and prisons: 

Guarding police around when u do the mission.

steal weapons from them, vehicles, or rescue a npc from the jail. this will be also cool to raid the prison. when u rescue a npc from prison the mission will fail when he dies.

police will chase u down ai and player police if it is a RP server.

delivery or sell location depens on what the mission is this can be random places, the npc will come to u on the location.

Bases or warehouses 

guarding npc's

chasing npc's and cop interacts.

stealing stuff from the warehouses items, objects, trucks.

delivery or sell location depens on what the mission is this can be random places, the npc will come to u on the location.

Military Airfield or basses

guarding military npc's

chasing military npc's and vehicles. air vehicles ground vehicles boats if delivery is on the water or a island around the gta5 map when the mission goes through water.

stealing vehicles airplanes helis or other military vehicles, weapons, kill a guarded npc, rescue a npc.

SHIT CANT WRITE MORE I'LL CONTINU!
delivery or sell location depens on what the mission is this can be random places, the npc will come to u on the location.
 this can be done with gangs as well
players versus npc's so ppl can do the same missions, other none friendly players can interact as well and finish the mission.

player cops can interact if it is a RP server based.

maybe a option if u play solo u can hire npc's to help u, so if u take a armored vehicle or w/e vehicle they help u shoot or use the weapons on the vehicles.
